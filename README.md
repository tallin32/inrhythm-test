## Implementations in both TypeScript and Java

I make certain assumptions here:
* You have node.js version 8 or higher, with latest NPM.
* You have Java at least 1.8 and Maven.
## Running the tests
### TypeScript
1. Change to the ts subdirectory.
2. Run `npm install`
3. run `npm test`
### Java
1.  Change to the "java" directory.
2. Run `mvn test`
## Notes
The TypeScript example is ... far more fleshed out.  This is because IntelliJ Idea and I had disagreements for an hour or two as to whether or not we were going to work together.  I won, but IntelliJ Idea didn't go down without a fight.
There are ways to do dynamic tests using JUnit.  I am aware of them.  I might have even been patient enough to use them, except see above.
